          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages, using "tags" and "elements" to organize content like headings, paragraphs, links, and images so web browsers can display them. It's the foundational "skeleton" of the web, defining the meaning and structure of content, while Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) handles appearance and JavaScript (JS) adds interactivity.

          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to define the visual presentation, formatting, and layout of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. 
          CSS works in tandem with HTML to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. While HTML provides the structure and content (e.g., text, images, links), CSS dictates how those elements should be displayed on various media like screens, paper, or mobile devices.

          JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It primarily adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites, allowing content to update, change, and react to user actions without requiring a full page reload.

          Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on a server or a local computer. This capability enables JavaScript to be used for server-side and networking applications, making it a full-stack language.

          React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) for web and mobile applications. Developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a large community of individual developers, it is known for its component-based architecture and efficient performance through the use of a virtual DOM.
